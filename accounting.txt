I would like you creating a document on testing. It should include a list of the tests that have been implemented and instructions on running single, groups or all tests. Add it to the "docs" documentation.

Can you create a "How to update the project version" document? So that should include the list of files where the project version needs to be updated (i.e. the pyproject.toml file and a list of __init__.py files). This should be a procedure an operator can follow.

I'd like to rework the "Decision Flow Architecture" to make it more clear. Then we'll need to check the requirements to make sure things are still aligned. I you to outline the steps involved in initialization: Define the starting state. Then walk through the steps, like in a sequence diagram. This should clarify the decision making process and the flow of the system overall.
