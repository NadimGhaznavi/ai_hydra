Can you create a "How to update the project version" document? So that should include the list of files where the project version needs to be updated (i.e. the pyproject.toml file and a list of __init__.py files). This should be a procedure an operator can follow.

I'd like to rework the "Decision Flow Architecture" to make it more clear. Then we'll need to check the requirements to make sure things are still aligned. I you to outline the steps involved in initialization: Define the starting state. Then walk through the steps, like in a sequence diagram. This should clarify the decision making process and the flow of the system overall.

*** I see outstanding files that should have been checked in with the Auito Git Commit agent hook.
The hook is now working correctly since all outstanding changes have been committed. Your working tree is clean and ready for the next development cycle.

It looks like you introduced a lot of errors with the decision_flow.rst document. Please fix and also test your work going forward. Expand the test suite as needed.
